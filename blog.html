                    <p>I've been in New York since July. So a couple of months. I'm so ready to go back home! I'm going home for thanksgiving. Being in college is nice, but I do miss home. I'm super excited to see all of my family back home as well!</p>

                    <p>Did you know that I was bilingual? I can speak English and Spanish. My parents are both Hondurian, so they taught me and my siblings. It was my first language.</p>

                    <p>Which is better, apple or orange juice? I absolutely despise apples, but apple juice is better in my opinion. Orange juice just tastes so sour and doesn't do anything for me. Apple juice can also be mixed with a variety of juices. Cranberry juice, pomegranate, etc.</p>
